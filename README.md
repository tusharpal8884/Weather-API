How It Works ⚙️
SkyCast works by connecting to powerful weather APIs to fetch data in real-time. It follows a simple, two-step process:

Finding a Location: When you search for a city, the app first uses the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to translate your city name into precise latitude and longitude coordinates. 🗺️ The "Use my location" button simplifies this step by using your browser's built-in geolocation feature to get your coordinates directly.

Fetching the Forecast: Once it has the coordinates, the app makes a second call to the Open-Meteo Forecast API to pull down all the detailed weather information you see on the screen—the current conditions, hourly temperatures, and the 7-day outlook. 🛰️

It's a seamless process to bring the world's weather right to your fingertips! ✨
